Scott Hudson wrote the original EvalVite algorithm.  He deserves all the credit for it.

It appeared in: 
A System for Efficient and Flexible One-Way Constraint Evaluation in C++
in 1993.

He also wrote the Java version:
Ultra-lightweight constraints
in 1996.

I believe that the original algorithm was implemented
as part of Artkit and was integrated into that
toolkit at a low level.  Because I didn't have access to 
Artkit, I just had to improvise in terms of the integration
with Seven5.
